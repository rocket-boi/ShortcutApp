Installation Instructions:
Place "Shortcut App.exe" in the startup folder.
The startup folder can be accessed by pressing Windows + R, and then entering "shell:startup" without the double quotes.

How to use:
Once the shortcut app is started, it lives in the taskbar on the bottom right. It is a black keyboard icon. Double click or right click it and select 'Edit Shortcuts' to open the shortcut list.
To define or edit a shortcut, hit the 'New Shortcut' or 'Edit' buttons.
Enter a web address, file or folder path, or any single line command prompt command to run for the shortcut.
Enter a name for the shortcut and assign a key combo to it by clicking on the 'Key' textbox and holding the specified key combo. Valid key modifiers are Ctrl, Alt and Shift. Left and Right modifiers (the ctrl on the left side of the keyboard vs the right) are treated identically.
When all of the shortcut details have been filled out, hit OK to assign the shortcut.
OK out of the shortcut list to save all changes made.

To call a shortcut, hit Ctrl + Alt + Space to focus the shortcut app, and then hit the assigned key combo for your shortcut.

Query function:
The shortcut app can query the user for one text input depending on how the command is set up. By using the character '|' in the command, the application will ask the user for a text input before executing the command. This is especially useful for something like a URL with a query string such as a google or wikipedia search.
If you hit a shortcut that calls the command "https://www.google.com/search?q=|", the shortcut app will query you for a text input. Lets say you enter "Seattle, WA"; the URL that will open is "https://www.google.com/search?q=Seattle, WA". 

The below are some examples of commands that utilize the '|' character. Other creative uses are possible.
